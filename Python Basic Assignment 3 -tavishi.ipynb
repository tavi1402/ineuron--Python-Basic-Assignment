    "# 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. \n",
    "- Use of functions enhances the readability of a program. A big code is always difficult to read. Breaking the code in smaller Functions keeps the program organized, easy to understand and makes it reusable.\n"

    "\n",
